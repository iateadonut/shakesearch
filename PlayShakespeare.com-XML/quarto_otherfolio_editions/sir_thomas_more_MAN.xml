<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Compell me ye dogges face? thou thinkst thou hast the Goldsmithes wife in</line>
<line>hand, whom thou enticedst from her husband with all his plate, and when</line>
<line>thou turndst her home to him againe, madste him (like an Asse) pay for his</line>

<speech>
<speaker>WIL.</speaker>
<line>I bought them in Cheapeside, and paide my monie for them.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SHER.</speaker>
<line>He did Sir indeed, and you offer him wrong, bothe to take them from him, and</line>
<line>not restore him his monie neither.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAUE.</speaker>
<line>If he paid for them, let it suffise that I possesse them, Beefe and brewes</line>
<line>may serue such hindes, are Piggions meate for a coorse Carpenter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIN.</speaker>
<line>It is hard when Englishmens pacience must be thus ietted on by straungers</line>
<line>and they not dare to reuendge their owne wrongs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEO.</speaker>
<line>Lincolne, lets beate them downe, and beare no more of these abuses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIN.</speaker>
<line>we may not Betts, be pacient and heare more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>How now husband? what, one straunger take thy food from thee, and another</line>
<line>thy wife? bir Lady &#64258;esh and blood I thinke can hardly brooke that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIN.</speaker>
<line>will this geere neuer be otherwise? must these wrongs be thus endured?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEO.</speaker>
<line>let vs step in, and help to reuendge their iniurie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARD.</speaker>
<line>what art thou that talkest of reuendge? my Lord Ambassadour shall once more</line>
<line>make your Maior haue a check, if he punishe thee for this saucie presumption.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIL.</speaker>
<line>Indeed my Lord Maior, on the Ambassadours complainte, sent me to Newgate one</line>
<line>day, because (against my will) I tooke the wall of a straunger. you may doo any</line>
<line>thing, the Goldsmith&#8217;s wife, and mine now must be at your c&#275;maundment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEO.</speaker>
<line>The more patient fooles are ye bothe to suffer it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARD.</speaker>
<line>Suffer it? mend it thou or he if ye can or dare, I tell thee fellowe, and she were</line>
<line>the Maior of Londons wife, had I her once in my possession, I would keep her in spite</line>
<line>of him that durst say nay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEO.</speaker>
<line>I tell thee Lombard, these wordes should cost thy best cappe, were I not curbd</line>
<line>by dutie and obedience. The Maior of Londons wife? Oh God, shall it be thus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>why <NAMEREF>Bettes</NAMEREF>, am not I as deare to my husband, as my Lord Maiors wife to him, and</line>
<line>wilt [he] thou so neglectly suffer [his] thine owne shame? Hands off proude stranger or</line>
<line>him that bought me, if mens milkie harts dare not strike a straunger, yet wo</line>
<line>men beate them downe, ere they beare these abuses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARD.</speaker>
<line>Mistresse, I say you shall along with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Touche not <NAMEREF>Doll Williamson</NAMEREF>, least she lay thee along on Gods deare earthe.</line>
<stagedir>To Caueler</stagedir>
<line>And you Sir, that allow such coorse cates to Carpenters, whilste Pidgions which they</line>
<line>pay for, must serue your daintie appetite: deliuer them back to my husband again</line>
<line>or Ile call so many women to myne assistance, as weele not leaue one inche vn-</line>
<line>torne of thee. If our husbands must be brideled by lawe, and forced to beare your</line>
<line>wrongs, their wiues will be a little lawelesse, and soundly beate ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAUE.</speaker>
<line>Come away <NAMEREF>de Bard</NAMEREF>, and let vs g&#339; complaine to my Lord Ambassadour.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Ex. Ambo</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>I, g&#339;, and send him among vs, and weele giue him his welcome too. I am ashamed</line>
<line>that free borne Englishmen, hauing beatten straungers within their owne boun</line>
<line>should thus be brau&#8217;de and abusde by them at home.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHER.</speaker>
<line>It is not our lack of courage in the cause, but the stri&#392;t obedience that we are</line>
<line>bound too: I am the Goldsmith whose wrongs you talkte of, but how to redresse</line>
<line>yours or mine owne, is a matter beyond our abilities.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIN.</speaker>
<line>Not so, not so my good freends, I, though a meane man, a Broaker by profession and</line> 
<line>namd Iohn <NAMEREF>Lincolne</NAMEREF>, haue long time winckt at these vilde ennormitees with mighty</line>
<line>impacience, and, as these two bretheren heere (<NAMEREF>Betses<NAMEREF> by name) can witnesse with</line>
<line>losse of mine owne liffe would gladly remedie them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEO.</speaker>
<line>And he is in a good forwardnesse I tell ye, if all hit right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>As how, I pre thee? tell it to <NAMEREF>Doll Willia(m)son</NAMEREF>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIN.</speaker>
<line>you knowe the Spittle Sermons begin the next weeke, I haue drawne a bill</line>
<line>of our wrongs and the stra(un)gers insolencies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEO.</speaker>
<line>which he meanes the (pre)achers shall there openly p(u)blishe in the Pulpit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIL.</speaker>
<line>Oh but that they would, (y)faith, it would tickle our (straun)gers thorowly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>I, and if you men durst not vndertake it before God we women</line> 
<line>would. Take an honest woman from her husband! why it is intollerable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHER.</speaker>
<line>But how &#64257;nd ye the preachers affe&#392;ted to our proceeding?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIN.</speaker>
<line>Master do&#392;tor standish hath answered that it becomes not him to move any such thing in hissermon, and tells vs we must moue the Maior</line>
<line>and aldermen to reforme it, and doubts not but happie successe will ensue on statement of our wrongs.</line> 
<line>You shall perceiue ther&#8217;s no hurt in the Bill, heer&#8217;s a copie of it, I pray ye, heare it.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>

<stagedir>Reads.</stagedir>
<line><recite>To you all, the worshipful lords and masters of this city, that will take com</recite></line>
<line><recite>passion over the poor people your neighbors, and also of the great importable</recite></line>
<line><recite>hurts, losses, and hinderances, whereof proceedeth extreme poverty to all the</recite></line>
<line><recite>king&#8217;s subjects that inhabit within this city and suburbs of the same. For</recite></line>
<line><recite>so it is that aliens and strangers eat the bread from the fatherless children,</recite></line>
<line><recite>and take the living from all the artificers and the intercourse from all the merchants,</recite></line>
<line><recite>whereby poverty is so much increased, that every man bewaileth the misery</recite></line>
<line><recite>of other; for craftsmen be brought to beggary, and merchants to neediness.</recite></line>
<line><recite>Wherefore, the premises considered, the redress must be of the common knit and</recite></line>
<line><recite>united to one part. And as the hurt and damage grieveth all men, so must</recite></line>
<line><recite>all men see to their willing power for remedy, and not suffer the said</recite></line>
<line><recite>aliens in their wealth, and the natural born men of this region to come</recite></line>
<line><recite>to confusion.&#8221;</recite></line>

<line>Before God, &#8217;tis excellent; and I&#8217;ll maintain the suit to be honest.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SHERWIN.</speaker>
<line>Well, say &#8217;tis read, what is your further meaning in the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>What? Marry, list to me. No doubt but this will store us with friends enow, whose names we will closely keep in writing; and on May day next in the morning we&#8217;ll go forth a Maying, but make it the worst May day for the strangers that ever they saw. How say ye? Do ye subscribe, or are ye faint-hearted revolters?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Hold thee, George Betts, there&#8217;s my hand and my heart. By the Lord, I&#8217;ll make a captain among ye, and do somewhat to be talk of forever after.</line>

<scenelocation>London. The Sessions House.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Lord Mayor, Justice Suresby, Justices, Sheriff More, Sheriff, Smart, Lifter, Recorder, Officers)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>An arras is drawn, and behind it as in sessions sit the Lord Mayor, Justice Suresby, and other Justices; Sheriff More and the other Sheriff sitting by. Smart is the plaintiff, Lifter the prisoner at the bar. Recorder, Officers.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Having dispatched our weightier businesses,</line>
<line>We may give ear to petty felonies.</line>
<line>Master Sheriff More, what is this fellow?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord, he stands indicted for a purse;</line>
<line>He hath been tried, the jury is together.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Who sent him in?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line offset="4">That did I, my lord:</line>
<line>Had he had right, he had been hanged ere this;</line>
<line>The only captain of the cutpurse crew.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>What is his name?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>As his profession is, Lifter, my lord,</line>
<line>One that can lift a purse right cunningly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>And is that he accuses him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>The same, my lord, whom, by your honors leave,</line>
<line>I must say somewhat too, because I find</line>
<line>In some respects he is well worthy blame.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Good Master Justice Suresby, speak your mind;</line>
<line>We are well pleased to give you audience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Hear me, Smart; thou art a foolish fellow:</line>
<line>If Lifter be convicted by the law,</line>
<line>As I see not how the jury can acquit him,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll stand too &#8217;t thou art guilty of his death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord, that&#8217;s worthy the hearing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Listen, then, good Master More.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>I tell thee plain, it is a shame for thee,</line>
<line>With such a sum to tempt necessity;</line>
<line>No less than ten pounds, sir, will serve your turn,</line>
<line>To carry in your purse about with ye,</line>
<line>To crake and brag in taverns of your money:</line>
<line>I promise ye, a man that goes abroad</line>
<line>With an intent of truth, meeting such a booty,</line>
<line>May be provoked to that he never meant.</line>
<line>What makes so many pilferers and felons,</line>
<line>But such fond baits that foolish people lay</line>
<line>To tempt the needy miserable wretch?</line>
<line>Ten pounds, odd money; this is a pretty sum</line>
<line>To bear about, which were more safe at home.</line>
<line>&#8217;Fore God, &#8217;twere well to fine ye as much more</line>
<stagedir>Lord Mayor and More whisper.</stagedir>
<line>To the relief of the poor prisoners,</line>
<line>To teach ye be more careful of your own,</line>
<line>In sooth, I say ye were but rightly served,</line>
<line>If ye had lost as much as twice ten pounds.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Good my lord, sooth a point or two for once,</line>
<line>Only to try conclusions in this case.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Content, good Master More. We&#8217;ll rise awhile,</line>
<line>And, till the jury can return their verdict,</line>
<line>Walk in the garden. How say ye, Justices?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>We like it well, my lord; we&#8217;ll follow ye.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Lord Mayor and Justices.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, plaintiff, go you too;&#8212;and officers,</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt Smart.</stagedir>
<line>Stand you aside, and leave the prisoner</line>
<line>To me awhile. Lifter, come hither.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>What is your worship&#8217;s pleasure?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Sirrah, you know that you are known to me,</line>
<line>And I have often saved ye from this place,</line>
<line>Since first I came in office. Thou seest beside,</line>
<line>That Justice Suresby is thy heavy friend,</line>
<line>By all the blame that he pretends to Smart,</line>
<line>For tempting thee with such a sum of money.</line>
<line>I tell thee what; devise me but a means</line>
<line>To pick or cut his purse, and, on my credit,</line>
<line>And as I am a Christian and a man,</line>
<line>I will procure they pardon for that jest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Good Master Sheriff, seek not my overthrow:</line>
<line>You know, sir, I have many heavy friends,</line>
<line>And more indictments like to come upon me.</line>
<line>You are too deep for me to deal withal;</line>
<line>You are known to be one of the wisest men</line>
<line>That is in England. I pray ye, Master Sheriff,</line>
<line>Go not about to undermine my life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Lifter, I am true subject to my king;</line>
<line>Thou much mistak&#8217;st me. And, for thou shall not think</line>
<line>I mean by this to hurt thy life at all,</line>
<line>I will maintain the act when thou hast done it.</line>
<line>Thou knowest there are such matters in my hands,</line>
<line>As if I pleased to give them to the jury,</line>
<line>I should not need this way to circumvent thee.</line>
<line>All that I aim at is a merry jest:</line>
<line>Perform it, Lifter, and expect my best.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>I thank your worship. God preserve your life!</line>
<line>But Master Justice Suresby is gone in;</line>
<line>I know not how to come near where he is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Let me alone for that; I&#8217;ll be thy setter;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll send him hither to thee presently,</line>
<line>Under the colour of thine own request</line>
<line>Of private matters to acquaint him with.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>If ye do so, sir, then let me alone;</line>
<line>Forty to one but then his purse is gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Well said. But see that thou diminish not</line>
<line>One penny of the money, but give it me;</line>
<line>It is the cunning act that credits thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>I will, good Master Sheriff, I assure ye.</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt More.</stagedir>
<line>I see the purpose of this gentleman</line>
<line>Is but to check the folly of the Justice,</line>
<line>For blaming others in a desperate case,</line>
<line>Wherein himself may fall as soon as any.</line>
<line>To save my life, it is a good adventure:</line>
<line>Silence there, ho! Now doth the Justice enter.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Justice Suresby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Now, sirrah, now, what is your will with me?</line>
<line>Wilt thou discharge thy conscience like an honest man?</line>
<line>What sayest to me, sirrah? Be brief, be brief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>As brief, sir, as I can.</line>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>If ye stand fair, I will be brief anon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Speak out, and mumble not. What sayest thou, sirrah?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I am charged, as God shall be my comfort,</line>
<line>With more than&#8217;s true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Sir, sir, ye are indeed, with more than&#8217;s true,</line>
<line>For you are flatly charged with felony;</line>
<line>You&#8217;re charged with more than truth, and that is theft;</line>
<line>More than a true man should be charged withal;</line>
<line>Thou art a varlet, that&#8217;s no more than true.</line>
<line>Trifle not with me; do not, do not, sirrah;</line>
<line>Confess but what thou knowest, I ask no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>There be, sir, there be, if&#8217;t shall please your worship&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;There be,&#8217; varlet! What be there? Tell me what there be.</line>
<line>Come off or on. &#8216;There be!&#8217; What be there, knave?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>There be, sir, diverse very cunning fellows,</line>
<line>That, while you stand and look them in the face,</line>
<line>Will have your purse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Th&#8217;art an honest knave:</line>
<line>Tell me what are they? Where they may be caught?</line>
<line>Aye, those are they I look for.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You talk of me, sir;</line>
<line>Alas, I am a puny! There&#8217;s one indeed</line>
<line>Goes by my name, he puts down all for purses;</line>
<line>He&#8217;ll steal your worship&#8217;s purse under your nose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Ha, ha! Art thou so sure, varlet?</line>
<line>Well, well,</line>
<line>Be as familiar as thou wilt, my knave;</line>
<line>Tis this I long to know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>And you shall have your longing ere ye go.</line>
<line>This fellow, sir, perhaps will meet ye thus,</line>
<line>Or thus, or thus, and in kind compliment</line>
<line>Pretend acquaintance, somewhat doubtfully;</line>
<line>And these embraces serve&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Aye, marry, Lifter, wherefore serve they?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Shrugging gladly.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Only to feel</line>
<line>Whether you go full under sail or no,</line>
<line>Or that your lading be aboard your bark.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>In plainer English, Lifter, if my purse</line>
<line>Be stored or no?</line>

<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Ye have it, sir.</line>

<line offset="6">Excellent, excellent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Then, sir, you cannot but for manner&#8217;s sake</line>
<line>Walk on with him; for he will walk your way,</line>
<line>Alleging either you have much forgot him,</line>
<line>Or he mistakes you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>But in this time has he my purse or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>

<line>But let them gull me, widgen me, rook me, fop me!</line>
<line>I&#8217;faith, i&#8217;faith, they are too short for me.</line>

<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Then, gentlemen, as you are wont to do,</line>
<line>Because as yet we have no burial place,</line>
<line>What charity your meaning&#8217;s to bestow</line>
<line>Toward burial of the prisoners now condemned,</line>
<line>Let it be given. There is first for me.</line>

<line>Ye had a purse about ye?</line>

<line>Sure, Master Sheriff! As sure as you are there,</line>
<line>And in it seven pounds, odd money, on my faith.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Seven pounds, odd money! What, were you so mad,</line>
<line>Being a wise man and a magistrate,</line>
<line>To trust your purse with such a liberal sum?</line>
<line>Seven pounds, odd money! &#8217;Fore God, it is a shame,</line>
<line>With such a sum to tempt necessity:</line>
<line>I promise ye, a man that goes abroad</line>
<line>With an intent of truth, meeting such a booty,</line>
<line>May be wrought to that he never thought.</line>
<line>What makes so many pilferers and felons,</line>
<line>But these fond baits that foolish people lay</line>
<line>To tempt the needy miserable wretch?</line>
<line>Should he be taken now that has your purse,</line>
<line>I&#8217;d stand to&#8217;t, you are guilty of his death;</line>
<line>For, questionless, he would be cast by law.</line>
<line>Twere a good deed to fine ye as much more,</line>
<line>To the relief of the poor prisoners,</line>
<line>To teach ye lock your money up at home.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Well, Master More, you are a merry man;</line>
<line>I find ye, sir, I find ye well enough.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, ye shall see, sir, trusting thus your money,</line>
<line>And Lifter here in trial for like case,</line>
<line>But that the poor man is a prisoner,</line>
<line>It would be now suspected that he had it.</line>
<line>Thus may ye see what mischief often comes</line>
<line>By the fond carriage of such needless sums.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Believe me, Master Suresby, this is strange,</line>
<line>You, being a man so settled in assurance,</line>

<line>My lord of Surrey, and Sir Thomas Palmer</line>
<line>Might I with patience tempt your grave advice,</line>
<line>I tell ye true, that in these dangerous times</line>
<line>I do not like this frowning vulgar brow:</line>
<line>My searching eye did never entertain</line>
<line>A more distracted countenance of grief</line>
<line>Than I have late observed</line>
<line>In the displeased commons of the city.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis strange that from his princely clemency,</line>
<line>So well a tempered mercy and a grace,</line>
<line>To all the aliens in this fruitful land,</line>
<line>That this high-crested insolence should spring</line>
<line>From them that breathe from his majestic bounty,</line>
<line>That, fattened with the traffic of our country,</line>
<line>Already leaps into his subjects&#8217; face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PALMER.</speaker>
<line>Yet Sherwin, hindered to commence his suit</line>
<line>Against De Barde by the ambassador,</line>
<line>By supplication made unto the king,</line>
<line>Who having first enticed away his wife,</line>
<line>And got his plate, near worth four hundred pound,</line>
<line>To grieve some wronged citizens that found</line>
<line>This vile disgrace oft cast into their teeth,</line>
<line>Of late sues Sherwin, and arrested him</line>
<line>For money for the boarding of his wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>The more knave Barde, that, using Sherwin&#8217;s goods,</line>
<line>Doth ask him interest for the occupation.</line>
<line>I like not that, my lord of Shrewsbury:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CHOLMLEY.</speaker>
<line>My lord of Surrey will be pleasant still.</line>

<speaker>PALMER.</speaker>
<line>Aye, being then employed by your honors</line>
<line>To stay the broil that fell about the same,</line>
<line>Where by persuasion I enforced the wrongs,</line>
<line>And urged the grief of the displeased city,</line>
<line>He answered me, and with a solemn oath,</line>
<line>That, if he had the Mayor of London&#8217;s wife,</line>
<line>He would keep her in despite of any English.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis good, Sir Thomas, then, for you and me;</line>
<line>Your wife is dead, and I a bachelor:</line>
<line>If no man can possess his wife alone,</line>
<line>I am glad, Sir Thomas Palmer, I have none.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHOLMLEY.</speaker>
<line>If a take a wife, &#8217;a shall find her meet.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>And reason good, Sir Roger Cholmley, too.</line>
<line>If these hot Frenchmen needsly will have sport,</line>
<line>They should in kindness yet defray the charge:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis hard when men possess our wives in quiet,</line>
<line>And yet leave us in, to discharge their diet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, our catours shall not use the market</line>
<line>For our provision, but some stranger now</line>
<line>Will take the vittailes from him he hath bought:</line>
<line>A carpenter, as I was late informed,</line>
<line>Who having bought a pair of doves in Cheap,</line>
<line>Immediately a Frenchman took them from him,</line>
<line>And beat the poor man for resisting him;</line>
<line>And when the fellow did complain his wrongs,</line>
<line>He was severely punished for his labor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>But if the English blood be once but up,</line>
<line>As I perceive their hearts already full,</line>
<line>I fear me much, before their spleens be cold,</line>
<line>Some of these saucy aliens for their pride</line>
<line>Will pay for &#8217;t soundly, wheresoe&#8217;er it lights:</line>
<line>This tide of rage that with the eddy strives,</line>
<line>I fear me much, will drown too many lives.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHOLMLEY.</speaker>
<line>Now, afore God, your honors, pardon me:</line>
<line>Men of your place and greatness are to blame.</line>
<line>I tell ye true, my lords, in that his majesty</line>
<line>Is not informed of this base abuse</line>

<line>A number poor artificers are up</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SERGEANT.</speaker>
<line>You are the simplest things that ever stood</line>
<line>In such a question.</line>

<line>The noble Earl of Shrewsbury, let&#8217;s hear him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll hear the Earl of Surrey.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>The Earl of Shrewsbury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll hear both.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Both, both, both, both!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Peace, I say, peace! Are you men of wisdom, or what are you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>What you will have them; but not men of wisdom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll not hear my lord of Surrey; no, no, no, no, no! Shrewsbury,</line>
<line>Shrewsbury!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Whiles they are o&#8217;er the bank of their obedience,</line>
<line>Thus will they bear down all things.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Sheriff More speaks; shall we hear Sheriff More speak?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Let&#8217;s hear him. &#8217;A keeps a plentyful shrievaltry, and &#8217;a made my brother Arthur Watchins Seriant Safes yeoman. Let&#8217;s hear Sheriff More.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Sheriff More, More, More, Sheriff More!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Even by the rule you have among yourselves,</line>
<line>Command still audience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Surrey, Surrey! More, More!</line>

<speech>

<line>Peace, peace, silence, peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>Peace, peace, silence, peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>You that have voice and credit with the number</line>
<line>Command them to a stillness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>A plague on them, they will not hold their peace; the dual cannot rule them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Then what a rough and riotous charge have you,</line>
<line>To lead those that the dual cannot rule?&#8212;</line>
<line>Good masters, hear me speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Aye, by th&#8217; mass, will we, More. Th&#8217; art a good housekeeper, and I thank thy good worship for my brother Arthur Watchins.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Peace, peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Look, what you do offend you cry upon,</line>
<line>That is, the peace. Not one of you here present,</line>
<line>Had there such fellows lived when you were babes,</line>
<line>That could have topped the peace, as now you would,</line>
<line>The peace wherein you have till now grown up</line>
<line>Had been ta&#8217;en from you, and the bloody times</line>
<line>Could not have brought you to the state of men.</line>
<line>Alas, poor things, what is it you have got,</line>
<line>Although we grant you get the thing you seek?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>Marry, the removing of the strangers, which cannot choose but much advantage the poor handicrafts of the city.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Grant them removed, and grant that this your noise</line>
<line>Hath chid down all the majesty of England;</line>
<line>Imagine that you see the wretched strangers,</line>
<line>Their babies at their backs and their poor luggage,</line>
<line>Plodding tooth ports and costs for transportation,</line>
<line>And that you sit as kings in your desires,</line>
<line>Authority quite silent by your brawl,</line>
<line>And you in ruff of your opinions clothed;</line>
<line>What had you got? I&#8217;ll tell you. You had taught</line>
<line>How insolence and strong hand should prevail,</line>
<line>How order should be quelled; and by this pattern</line>
<line>Not one of you should live an aged man,</line>
<line>For other ruffians, as their fancies wrought,</line>
<line>With self same hand, self reasons, and self right,</line>
<line>Would shark on you, and men like ravenous fishes</line>
<line>Would feed on one another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Before God, that&#8217;s as true as the Gospel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Nay, this is a sound fellow, I tell you. Let&#8217;s mark him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Let me set up before your thoughts, good friends,</line>
<line>On supposition; which if you will mark,</line>
<line>You shall perceive how horrible a shape</line>
<line>Your innovation bears. First, &#8217;tis a sin</line>
<line>Which oft the apostle did forewarn us of,</line>
<line>Urging obedience to authority;</line>
<line>And &#8217;twere no error, if I told you all,</line>
<line>You were in arms against your God himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Marry, God forbid that!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, certainly you are;</line>
<line>For to the king God hath his office lent</line>
<line>Of dread, of justice, power and command,</line>
<line>Hath bid him rule, and willed you to obey;</line>
<line>And, to add ampler majesty to this,</line>
<line>He hath not only lent the king his figure,</line>
<line>His throne and sword, but given him his own name,</line>
<line>Calls him a god on earth. What do you, then,</line>
<line>Rising &#8217;gainst him that God himself installs,</line>
<line>But rise against God? What do you to your souls</line>
<line>In doing this? O, desperate as you are,</line>
<line>Wash your foul minds with tears, and those same hands,</line>
<line>That you like rebels lift against the peace,</line>
<line>Lift up for peace, and your unreverent knees,</line>
<line>Make them your feet to kneel to be forgiven!</line>
<line>Tell me but this. What rebel captain,</line>
<line>As mutinies are incident, by his name</line>
<line>Can still the rout? Who will obey a traitor?</line>
<line>Or how can well that proclamation sound,</line>
<line>When there is no addition but a rebel</line>
<line>To qualify a rebel? You&#8217;ll put down strangers,</line>
<line>Kill them, cut their throats, possess their houses,</line>
<line>And lead the majesty of law in line,</line>
<line>To slip him like a hound. Say now the king</line>
<line>(As he is clement, if th&#8217; offender mourn)</line>
<line>Should so much come to short of your great trespass</line>
<line>As but to banish you, whether would you go?</line>
<line>What country, by the nature of your error,</line>
<line>Should give you harbor? Go you to France or Flanders,</line>
<line>To any German province, to Spain or Portugal,</line>
<line>Nay, any where that not adheres to England,&#8212;</line>
<line>Why, you must needs be strangers. Would you be pleased</line>
<line>To find a nation of such barbarous temper,</line>
<line>That, breaking out in hideous violence,</line>
<line>Would not afford you an abode on earth,</line>
<line>Whet their detested knives against your throats,</line>
<line>Spurn you like dogs, and like as if that God</line>
<line>Owed not nor made not you, nor that the claimants</line>
<line>Were not all appropriate to your comforts,</line>
<line>But chartered unto them, what would you think</line>
<line>To be thus used? This is the strangers&#8217; case;</line>
<line>And this your mountanish inhumanity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Faith, &#8217;a says true. Let&#8217;s do as we may be done to.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll be ruled by you, Master More, if you&#8217;ll stand our friend to procure our pardon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Submit you to these noble gentlemen,</line>
<line>Entreat their mediation to the king,</line>
<line>Give up yourself to form, obey the magistrate,</line>
<line>And there&#8217;s no doubt but mercy may be found,</line>
<line>If you so seek.</line>
<line>To persist in it is present death. But, if you</line>
<line>Yield yourselves, no doubt what punishment</line>
<line>You in simplicity have incurred, his highness</line>
<line>In mercy will most graciously pardon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>We yield, and desire his highness&#8217; mercy.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They lay by their weapons.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>No doubt his majesty will grant it you:</line>
<line>But you must yield to go to several prisons,</line>
<line>Till that his highness&#8217; will be further known.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>

<line>Lord Mayor, let them be sent to several prisons,</line>

<line>My lord of Surrey, please you to take horse,</line>
<line>And ride to Cheapside, where the aldermen</line>
<line>Are with their several companies in arms;</line>
<line>Will them to go unto their several wards,</line>
<line>Both for the stay of further mutiny,</line>

<line>As shall contend.</line>

<line offset="3">I go, my noble lord.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Surrey.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll straight go tell his highness these good news;</line>
<line>Withal, Sheriff More, I&#8217;ll tell him how your breath</line>
<line>Hath ransomed many a subject from sad death.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Shrewsbury and Cholmley.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Lincoln and Sherwin, you shall both to Newgate;</line>
<line>The rest unto the Counters.</line>

<line>Go guard them hence. A little breath well spent</line>
<line>Cheats expectation in his fairest event.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Well, Sheriff More, thou hast done more with thy good words than all they could with their weapons. Give me thy hand, keep thy promise now for the king&#8217;s pardon, or, by the Lord, I&#8217;ll call thee a plain coney-catcher.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Farewell, Sheriff More; and as we yield by thee,</line>
<line>So make our peace; then thou dealst honestly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Aye, and save us from the gallows, else &#8217;a devil&#8217;s double honestly!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They are led away.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Master Sheriff More, you have preserved the city</line>
<line>From a most dangerous fierce commotion;</line>
<line>For, if this limb of riot here in St. Martin&#8217;s</line>
<line>Had joined with other branches of the city</line>
<line>That did begin to kindle, &#8217;twould have bred</line>
<line>Great rage; that rage much murder would have fed.</line>
<line>Not steel, but eloquence hath wrought this good:</line>
<line>You have redeemed us from much threatened blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord and brethren, what I here have spoke,</line>
<line>My country&#8217;s love, and next the city&#8217;s care,</line>
<line>Enjoined me to; which since it thus prevails,</line>
<line>Think, God hath made weak More his instrument</line>
<line>To thwart sedition&#8217;s violent intent.</line>
<line>I think &#8217;twere best, my lord, some two hours hence</line>
<line>We meet at the Guildhall, and there determine</line>
<line>That thorough every ward the watch be clad</line>
<line>In armor, but especially proud</line>
<line>That at the city gates selected men,</line>
<line>Substantial citizens, do ward tonight,</line>
<line>For fear of further mischief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">It shall be so:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, his majesty sends loving thanks</line>
<line>To you, your brethren, and his faithful subjects,</line>
<line>Your careful citizens. But, Master More, to you</line>
<line>A rougher, yet as kind, a salutation:</line>
<line>A knights creation is this knightly steel.</line>
<line>Rise up, Sir Thomas More.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I thank his highness for thus honoring me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>This is but first taste of his princely favor:</line>
<line>For it hath pleased his high majesty</line>
<line>(Noting your wisdom and deserving merit)</line>
<line>To put this staff of honor in your hand,</line>
<line>For he hath chose you of his Privy Council.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord, for to deny my sovereign&#8217;s bounty</line>
<line>Were to drop precious stones into the heaps</line>
<line>Whence they first came;</line>
<line>To urge my imperfections in excuse,</line>
<line>Were all as stale as custom. No, my lord,</line>
<line>My service is my kings; good reason why,&#8212;</line>
<line>Since life or death hangs on our sovereign&#8217;s eye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line offset="5">My lord and brethren,</line>
<line>Though I depart for court my love shall rest</line>
<line>With you, as heretofore, a faithful guest.</line>
<line>I now must sleep in court, sound sleeps forbear;</line>
<line>The chamberlain to state is public care:</line>
<line>Yet, in this rising of my private blood,</line>
<line>My studious thoughts shall tend the city&#8217;s good.</line>

<line>That&#8217;s well said, fellow; now you do your duty.</line>

<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>I, for I cry lug, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>I knew the first, sir, did belong to me:</line>
<line>This the old proverb now complete doth make,</line>
<line>That &#8216;Lincoln should be hanged for London&#8217;s sake.&#8217;</line>
<stagedir>He goes up.</stagedir>
<line>I&#8217;God&#8217;s name, let us to work. Fellow, dispatch:</line>

<line>Bravely, John Lincoln, let thy death express,</line>
<line>That, as thou liv&#8217;dst a man, thou diest no less.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Doll Williamson, thine eyes shall witness it.</line>
<line>Then to all you that come to view mine end</line>
<line>I must confess, I had no ill intent,</line>
<line>But against such as wronged us over much:</line>
<line>And now I can perceive it was not fit</line>
<line>That private men should carve out their redress,</line>
<line>Which way they list; no, learn it now by me,&#8212;</line>
<line>Obedience is the best in each degree:</line>
<line>And asking mercy meekly of my king,</line>
<line>I patiently submit me to the law;</line>
<line>But God forgive them that were cause of it!</line>
<line>And, as a Christian, truly from my heart</line>
<line>I likewise crave they would forgive me too</line>
<line>(As freely as I do forgive their wrong)</line>
<line>That others by example of the same</line>
<line>Henceforth be warned to attempt the like</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst any alien that repaireth hither.</line>

<line>Woman, what is it? Be it in my power,</line>
<line>Thou shalt obtain it.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Let me die next, sir; that is all I crave:</line>
<line>You know not what a comfort you shall bring</line>
<line>To my poor heart, to die before my husband.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Sir, and I have a suit for you too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>What is it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>That, as you have hanged Lincoln first, and will hang her next, so you will not hang me at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Nay, you set ope&#8217; the Counter gates, and you must hang for the folly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Well, then, so much for it!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Sir, your free bounty much contents my mind.</line>
<line>Commend me to that good Sheriff Master More,</line>
<line>And tell him, had&#8217;t not been for his persuasion,</line>
<line>John Lincoln had not hung here as he does:</line>
<line>We would first have locked us up in Leadenhall,</line>
<line>And there been burnt to ashes with the roof.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Woman, what Master More did was a subject&#8217;s duty,</line>
<line>And hath so pleased our gracious lord the king,</line>
<line>That he is hence removed to higher place,</line>
<line>And made of council to his majesty.</line>

<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Well is he worthy of it, by my troth,</line>
<line>An honest, wise, well-spoken gentleman;</line>
<line>Yet would I praise his honesty much more,</line>
<line>If he had kept his word, and saved our lives:</line>
<line>But let that pass; men are but men, and so</line>
<line>Words are but words, and pays not what men owe.</line>
<line>You, husband, since perhaps the world may say</line>
<line>That through my means thou comest thus to thy end,</line>
<line>Here I begin this cup of death to thee,</line>
<line>Because thou shalt be sure to taste no worse</line>
<line>Than I have taken that must go before thee.</line>
<line>What though I be a woman? That&#8217;s no matter;</line>
<line>I do owe God a death, and I must pay him.</line>
<line>Husband, give me thy hand; be not dismayed;</line>
<line>This chair being chaired, then all our debt is paid.</line>
<line>Only two little babes we leave behind us,</line>
<line>And all I can bequeath them at this time</line>
<line>Is but the love of some good honest friend,</line>
<line>To bring them up in charitable sort:</line>
<line>What, masters! He goes upright that never halts,</line>
<line>And they may live to mend their parents&#8217; faults.</line>

<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>Why, well said, wife; i&#8217;faith, thou cheerest my heart:</line>
<line>Give me thy hand; let&#8217;s kiss, and so let&#8217;s part.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He kisses her on the ladder.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>The next kiss, Williamson, shall be in heaven.</line>
<line>Now cheerily, lads! George Betts, a hand with thee;</line>
<line>And thine too, Rafe, and thine, good honest Sherwin.</line>
<line>Now let me tell the women of this town,</line>
<line>No stranger yet brought Doll to lying down:</line>
<line>So long as I an Englishman can see,</line>
<line>Nor French nor Dutch shall get a kiss of me;</line>
<line>And when that I am dead, for me yet say,</line>
<line>I died in scorn to be a stranger&#8217;s prey.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>Sir Thomas More humbly upon his knee</line>
<line>Did beg the lives of all, since on his word</line>
<line>They did so gently yield. The king hath granted it,</line>
<line>And made him Lord High Chancellor of England.</line>
<line>According as he worthily deserves.</line>
<line>Since Lincoln&#8217;s life cannot be had again,</line>

<line>To shun such lewd assemblies as beget</line>
<line>Unlawful riots and such traitorous acts,</line>
<line>That, striking with the hand of private hate,</line>
<line>Maim your dear country with a public wound:&#8212;</line>
<line>Oh God, that Mercy, whose majestic brow</line>
<line>Should be unwrinkled, and that awful Justice,</line>
<line>Which looketh through a vail of sufferance</line>
<line>Upon the frailty of the multitude,</line>
<line>Should with the clamours of outrageous wrongs</line>

<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>It is in heaven that I am thus and thus;</line>
<line>And that which we profanely term our fortunes</line>
<line>Is the provision of the power above,</line>
<line>Fitted and shaped just to that strength of nature</line>
<line>Which we are borne withal. Good God, good God,</line>
<line>That I from such an humble bench of birth</line>
<line>Should step as &#8217;twere up to my country&#8217;s head,</line>
<line>And give the law out there! I, in my father&#8217;s life,</line>
<line>To take prerogative and tithe of knees</line>
<line>From elder kinsmen, and him bind by my place</line>
<line>To give the smooth and dexter way to me</line>
<line>That owe it him by nature! Sure, these things,</line>
<line>Not physicked by respect, might turn our blood</line>
<line>To much corruption. But, More, the more thou hast,</line>
<line>Either of honor, office, wealth, and calling,</line>
<line>Which might excite thee to embrace and hub them,</line>
<line>The more doe thou in serpents&#8217; natures think them;</line>
<line>Fear their gay skins with thought of their sharp state;</line>
<line>And let this be thy maxim, to be great</line>
<line>Is when the thread of hayday is once &#8217;spon,</line>

<line>The learned clark Erasmus is arrived</line>
<line>Within our English court. Last night I hear</line>
<line>He feasted with our honored English poet,</line>
<line>The Earl of Surrey; and I learned today</line>
<line>The famous clark of Rotterdam will visit</line>
<line>Sir Thomas More. Therefore, sir, take my seat;</line>
<line>You are Lord Chancellor. Dress your behavior</line>
<line>According to my carriage; but beware</line>
<line>You talk not over much, for twill betray thee:</line>
<line>Who prates not much seems wise; his wit few scan;</line>
<line>While the tongue blabs tales of the imperfect man.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll see if great Erasmus can distinguish</line>
<line>Merit and outward ceremony.</line>

<line>I&#8217;ll prove the street was not choked, but is as well as ever it was since it was a street.</line>

<line>This fellow was a principal broacher of the broil.</line>

<line>&#8217;Sblood, I broached none; it was broached and half run out, before I had a lick at it.</line>

<line>To be a secretary&#8217;s follower!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>I hope so, my lord. The fray was between the Bishops&#8217; men of Ely and Winchester; and I could not in honor but part them. I thought it stood not with my reputation and degree to come to my questions and answers before a city justice. I knew I should to the pot.</line>

<line>Thou hast been there, it seems, too late already.</line>

<line>You know that&#8217;s not my question, but how long</line>
<line>Hath this shag fleece hung dangling on they head?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>How long, my lord? Why, sometimes thus long, sometimes lower, as the Fates and humors please.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>So quick, sir, with me, ha? I see, good fellow,</line>
<line>Thou lovest plain dealing. Sirrah, tell me now,</line>
<line>When were you last at barber&#8217;s? How long time</line>
<line>Have you upon your head worn this shag hair?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>My lord, Jack Faulkner tells no Aesop&#8217;s fables. Troth, I was not at barber&#8217;s this three years; I have not been cut not will not be cut, upon a foolish vow, which, as the Destinies shall direct, I am sworn to keep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>When comes that vow out?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>Why, when the humors are purged, not this three years.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Vows are recorded in the court of Heaven,</line>
<line>For they are holy acts. Young man, I charge thee</line>
<line>And do advise thee, start not from that vow:</line>
<line>And, for I will be sure thou shalt not shear,</line>
<line>Besides, because it is an odious sight</line>
<line>To see a man thus hairy, thou shalt lie</line>
<line>In Newgate till thy vow and thy three years</line>
<line>Be full expired. Away with him!</line>

<line>Now, great Erasmus, you approach the presence</line>
<line>Of a most worthy learned gentleman:</line>
<line>This little isle holds not a truer friend</line>
<line>Unto the arts; nor doth his greatness add</line>
<line>A feigned flourish to his worthy parts;</line>
<line>He&#8217;s great in study; that&#8217;s the statist&#8217;s grace,</line>

<line>Report, my lord, hath crossed the narrow seas,</line>

<line offset="5">It is, Erasmus:</line>

<line>That study is the general watch of England;</line>
<line>In it the prince&#8217;s safety, and the peace</line>

<line>Yes, faith, my learned poet doth not lie for that matter. I am neither more nor less than merry Sir Thomas always. Wilt sup with me? By God, I love a parlous wise fellow that smells of a politician better than a long progress.</line>

<line>Your honor&#8217;s merry humor is best physic</line>

<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>Mad now? Nails, if loss of hair cannot mad a man, what can? I am deposed, my crown is taken from me. More had been better a&#8217; scoured Moreditch than a&#8217; notched me thus. Does he begin sheepshearing with Jack Faulkner?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORRIS.</speaker>
<line>Nay, and you feed this vein, sir, fare you well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>Why, farewell, frost. I&#8217;ll go hang myself out for the poll-head.</line>
<line>Make a Saracen of Jack?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORRIS.</speaker>
<line>Thou desperate knave! For that I see the devil</line>
<line>Wholly gets hold of thee&#8212;</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>The devil&#8217;s a damned rascal.</line>

<line>I charge thee, wait on me no more; no more</line>
<line>Call me thy master.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MORRIS.</speaker>
<line>Why dost thou follow me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>Because I&#8217;m an ass. Do you set your shavers upon me, and then cast me off? Must I condole? Have the Fates played the fools? Am I their cut? Now the poor sconce is taken, must Jack march with bag and baggage?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Weeps.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORRIS.</speaker>
<line>You coxcomb!</line>

<speech>

<line>Nay, you ha&#8217; poached me; you ha&#8217; given me a hair; it&#8217;s here, hear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORRIS.</speaker>
<line>Away, you kind ass! Come, sir, dry your eyes:</line>
<line>Keep you old place, and mend these fooleries.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>I care not to be turned off, and &#8217;twere a ladder, so it be in my humor, or the Fates beckon to me. Nay, pray, sir, if the Destinies spin me a fine thread, Faulkner flies another pitch; and to avoid the headache hereafter, before I&#8217;ll be a hairmonger, I&#8217;ll be a whoremonger.</line>

<line>Why, this is cheerful news. Friends go and come:</line>

<line>Newly took sad leave of me, and with tears</line>
<line>Troubled the silver channel of the Thames,</line>

<line><name type="title">The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom</name>? That, my lads;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll none but that; the theme is very good,</line>
<line>And may maintain a liberal argument:</line>
<line>To marry wit to wisdom, asks some cunning;</line>
<line>Many have wit, that may come short of wisdom.</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll see how Master poet plays his part,</line>

<line>True, upstart fools, by sudden fortune tried,</line>
<line>Regard their former mates with naught but pride.</line>
<line>But they that cast an eye still whence they came,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>My lord, you set a gloss on London&#8217;s fame,</line>
<line>And make it happy ever by your name.</line>
<line>Needs must we say, when we remember More,</line>
<line>&#8217;Twas he that drove rebellion from our door</line>

<line>That know not I; my lord will have it so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Wife, hope the best; I am sure they&#8217;ll do their best:</line>
<line>They that would better, comes not at their feast.</line>
<line>My good Lord Cardinal&#8217;s players, I thank them for it,</line>
<line>Play us a play, to lengthen out your welcome:</line>
<line>They say it is <name type="title">The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom</name>,</line>
<line>A theme of some import, howe&#8217;er it prove;</line>
<line>But, if art fail, we&#8217;ll inch it out with love.</line>
<stagedir>Enter a Servant.</stagedir>
<line>What, are they ready?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<line>My lord, one of the players craves to speak with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>With me? Where is he?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Inclination, the Vice, ready.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Here, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>How now! What&#8217;s the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>We would desire your honor but to stay a little; one of my fellows is but run to Oagles for a long beard for young Wit, and he&#8217;ll be here presently.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>A long beard for young Wit! Why, man, he may be without a beard till he come to marriage, for wit goes not all by the hair. When comes Wit in?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>In the second scene, next to the Prologue, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Why, play on till that scene come, and by that time Wit&#8217;s beard will be grown, or else the fellow returned with it. And what part playest thou?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Inclination the Vice, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Gramercies, now I may take the vice if I list. And wherefore hast thou that bridle in thy hand?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>I must be bridled anon, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>And thou beest not saddled too, it makes no matter, for then Wit&#8217;s inclination may gallop so fast, that he will outstrip Wisdom, and fall to folly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Indeed, so he does to Lady Vanity; but we have no folly in our play.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Then there&#8217;s no wit in &#8217;t, I&#8217;ll be sworn. Folly waits on wit, as the shadow on the body, and where wit is ripest there folly still is readiest. But begin, I prithee. We&#8217;ll rather allow a beardless Wit than Wit all beard to have no brain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Nay, he has his apparel on too, my lord, and therefore he is the readier to enter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Then, good Inclination, begin at a venter.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Inclination.</stagedir>
<line>My Lord Mayor,</line>
<line>Wit lacks a beard, or else they would begin:</line>
<line>I&#8217;d lend him mine, but that it is too thin.</line>
<line>Silence, they come.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>The trumpet sounds; enter the Prologue.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PROLOGUE.</speaker>
<line>Now, for as much as in these latter days,</line>
<line>Throughout the whole world in every land,</line>
<line>Vice doth increase, and virtue decays,</line>
<line>Iniquity having the upper hand;</line>
<line>We therefore intend, good gentle audience,</line>
<line>A pretty short interlude to play at this present,</line>
<line>Desiring your leave and quiet silence,</line>
<line>To show the same, as is meet and expedient,</line>
<line>It is called <name type="title">The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom</name>,</line>
<line>A matter right pithy and pleasing to hear,</line>
<line>Whereof in brief we will show the whole sum;</line>
<line>But I must be gone, for Wit doth appear.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit. Enter Wit ruffling, and Inclination the Vice.</stagedir>

<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<stagedir>Sings.</stagedir>
<line type="lyric">In an arbor green, asleep whereas I lay,</line>
<line type="lyric">The birds sang sweetly in the midst of the day,</line>
<line type="lyric">I dreamed fast of mirth and play,&#8212;</line>
<line type="lyric">In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure,</line>
<line type="lyric">Methought I walked still to and fro,</line>
<line type="lyric">And from her company I could not go;</line>
<line type="lyric">But when I waked, it was not so,&#8212;</line>
<line type="lyric">In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure.</line>
<line type="lyric">Therefore my heart is surely plight,</line>

<line type="lyric">In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Mark ye, my lord, this is Wit without a beard. What will he be by that time he comes to the commodity of a beard?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Oh, sir, the ground is the better on which she doth go;</line>
<line>For she will make better cheer with a little she can get,</line>
<line>Than many a one can with a great banquet of meat.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>And is her name Wisdom?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Ay, sir, a wife most fit</line>
<line>For you, my good master, my dainty sweet Wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>To be in her company my heart it is set:</line>
<line>Therefore I prithee to let us begone;</line>
<line>For unto Wisdom Wit hath inclination.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Oh, sir, she will come her self even anon;</line>
<line>For I told her before where we would stand.</line>
<line>And then she said she would beck us with her hand.</line>
<line>Back with these boys and saucy great knaves!</line>
<stagedir>Flourishing a dagger.</stagedir>
<line>What, stand ye here so big in your braves?</line>
<line>My dagger about your coxcombs shall walk,</line>
<line>If I may but so much as hear ye chat or talk.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>But will she take pains to come for us hither?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>I warrant ye; therefore you must be familiar with her;</line>
<line>When she commeth in place,</line>
<line>You must her embrace</line>
<line>Somewhat handsomely,</line>
<line>Least she think it danger,</line>
<line>Because you are a stranger,</line>
<line>To come in your company.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>I warrant thee, Inclination, I will be busy:</line>
<line>Oh, how Wit longs to be in Wisdom&#8217;s company!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lady Vanity singing, and beckoning with her hand.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>VANITY.</speaker>
<line>Come hither, come hither, come hither, come:</line>
<line>Such cheer as I have, thou shalt have some.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>This is Lady Vanity, I&#8217;ll hold my life:&#8212;</line>
<line>Beware, good Wit, you take not her to wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>What, unknown honesty? A word in your ear.</line>
<stagedir>She offers to depart.</stagedir>
<line>You shall not be gone as yet, I swear:</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s none but friends, you need not to fray;</line>
<line>This young gentleman loves ye, therefore you must stay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>I trust in me she will think no danger,</line>
<line>For I love well the company of fair women;</line>
<line>And though to you I am a stranger,</line>
<line>Yet Wit may pleasure you now and then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VANITY.</speaker>
<line>Who, you? Nay, you are such a holy man,</line>
<line>That to touch on you dare not be bold;</line>
<line>I think you would not kiss a young woman,</line>
<line>If one would give ye twenty pound in gold.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Yes, in good sadness, lady, that I would:</line>
<line>I could find in my heart to kiss you in your smock.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VANITY.</speaker>
<line>My back is broad enough to bear that mock;</line>
<line>For it hath been told me many a time</line>
<line>That you would be seen in no such company as mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Not Wit in the company of Lady Wisdom?</line>
<line>Oh Jove, for what do I hither come?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Sir, she did this nothing else but to prove</line>
<line>Whether a little thing would you move</line>
<line>To be angry and fret:</line>
<line>What, and if one said so?</line>
<line>Let such trifling matters go</line>
<line>And with a kind kiss come out of her debt.</line>
<line>Is Luggins come yet with the beard?</line>

<stagedir>Enter Prologue Player.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PROLOGUE.</speaker>
<line>No, faith, he is not come. Alas, what shall we do?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Forsooth, we can go no further till our fellow Luggins come; for he plays Good Council, and now he should enter, to admonish Wit that this is Lady Vanity, and not Lady Wisdom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, and it be no more but so, ye shall not tarry at a stand for that; we&#8217;ll not have our play marred for lack of a little good council. Till your fellow come, I&#8217;ll give him the best council that I can. Pardon me, my Lord Mayor; I love to be merry.</line>
<line>Oh...Wit, thou art now on the bow hand,</line>
<line>And blindly in thine own opinion dost stand.</line>
<line>I tell thee, this naughty lewd Inclination</line>
<line>Does lead thee amiss in a very strange fashion:</line>
<line>This is not Wisdom, but Lady Vanity;</line>
<line>Therefore list to Good Council, and be ruled by me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>In troth, my lord, it is as right to Lugginses part as can be. Speak, Wit.</line>

<line>Nay, we will not have our audience disappointed, if I can help it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Art thou Good Council, and will tell me so?</line>
<line>Wouldst thou have Wit from Lady Wisdom to go?</line>
<line>Thou art some deceiver, I tell thee verily,</line>
<line>In saying that this is Lady Vanity.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Wit, judge not things by the outward show;</line>
<line>The eye oft mistakes, right well you do know:</line>
<line>Good Council assures thee upon his honesty,</line>
<line>That this is not Wisdom, but Lady Vanity.</line>

<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Oh, my lord, he is come; now we shall go forward.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Art thou come? Well, fellow, I have hoped to save thine honesty a little. Now, if thou canst give Wit any better council than I have done, spare not. There I leave him to they mercy.</line>
<line>But by this time, I am sure, our banquet&#8217;s ready:</line>
<line>My lord and ladies, we will taste that first,</line>
<line>And then they shall begin the play again,</line>
<line>Which through the fellow&#8217;s absence, and by me,</line>
<line>Instead of helping, hath been hindered.</line>
<line>Prepare against we come. Lights there, I say!&#8212;</line>
<line>Thus fools oft times do help to mar the play.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt all but players.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Fie, fellow Luggins, you serve us handsomely; do ye not, think ye?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUGGINS.</speaker>
<line>Why, Oagle was not within, and his wife would not let me have the beard; and, by my troth, I ran so fast that I sweat again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Do ye hear, fellows? Would not my lord make a rare player? Oh, he would uphold a company beyond all hope, better than Mason among the king&#8217;s players! Did ye mark how extemprically he fell to the matter, and spake Lugginses part almost as it is in the very book set down?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Peace; do ye know what ye say? My lord a player! Let us not meddle with any such matters. Yet I may be a little proud that my lord hath answered me in my part. But come, let us go, and be ready to begin the play again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUGGINS.</speaker>
<line>I, that&#8217;s the best, for now we lack nothing.</line>

<speaker>ALL. PLAYERS.</speaker>
<line>Here, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAN.</speaker>
<line>My lord is sent for to the court,</line>
<line>And all the guests do after supper part;</line>
<line>And, for he will not trouble you again,</line>
<line>By me for your reward a sends 8 angels,</line>
<line>With many thanks. But sup before you go:</line>
<line>It is his will you should be fairly entreated:</line>
<line>Follow, I pray ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line offset="3">This, Luggins, is your negligence;</line>
<line>Wanting Wit&#8217;s beard brought things into dislike;</line>
<line>For otherwise the play had been all seen,</line>
<line>Where now some curious citizen disgraced it,</line>
<line>And discommending it, all is dismissed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Fore God, &#8217;a says true. But hear ye, sirs; eight angels, ha! My lord would never give eight angels more or less for twelve pence; other it should be three pounds, five pounds, or ten pounds. There&#8217;s twenty shillings wanting, sure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Twenty to one, &#8217;tis so. I have a trick. My lord comes; stand aside.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter More, with Attendants with purse and mace.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>In haste to counsel! What&#8217;s the business now,</line>
<line>That all so late his highness sends for me?&#8212;</line>
<line>What seek&#8217;st thou, fellow?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Nay, nothing:</line>
<line>Your lordship sent eight angels by your man,</line>
<line>And I have lost two of them in the rushes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Wit, look to that:&#8212;eight angels! I did send them ten. Who gave it them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAN.</speaker>
<line>I, my lord; I had no more about me;</line>
<line>But by and by they shall rescue the rest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Well, Wit, &#8217;twas wisely done; thou play&#8217;st Wit well indeed,</line>
<line>Not to be thus deceived of thy right.</line>
<line>Am I a man, by office truly ordained</line>
<line>Equally to decide true right his own,</line>
<line>And shall I have deceivers in my house?</line>
<line>Then what avails my bounty, when such servants</line>
<line>Deceive the poor of what the Master gives?</line>
<line>Go on, and pull his coat over his ears:</line>
<line>There are too many such. Give them their right.</line>
<line>Wit, let thy fellows thank thee. &#8217;Twas well done;</line>
<line>Thou now deservest to match with Lady Wisdom.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit More with Attendants.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>God a mercy, Wit!&#8212;Sir, you had a master Sir Thomas More more; but now we shall have more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUGGINS.</speaker>
<line>God bless him! I would there were more of his mind! A loves our quality; and yet he&#8217;s a learned man, and knows what the world is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Well, a kind man, and more loving than many other. But I think we ha&#8217; met with the first&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUGGINS.</speaker>
<line>First served his man that had our angels; and he may chance dine with Duke Humphrey tomorrow, being turned away today. Come, let&#8217;s go.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>And many such rewards would make us all ride, and horse us with the best nags in Smithfield.</line>

<stagedir>They sit.</stagedir>
<line>Upon this little board is daily scanned</line>
<line>The health and preservation of the land;</line>
<line>We the physicians that effect this good,</line>

<line>Our toil and careful watching brings the king</line>
<line>In league with slumbers, to which peace doth sing.</line>
<line>Avoid the room there!&#8212;</line>
<line>What business, lords, today?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line offset="5">This, my good lord;</line>
<line>About the entertainment of the Emperor</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst the perfidious French into our pay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>My lords, as &#8217;tis the custom in this place</line>
<line>The youngest should speak first, so, if I chance</line>
<line>In this case to speak youngly, pardon me.</line>
<line>I will agree, France now hath her full strength,</line>
<line>As having new recovered the pale blood</line>
<line>Which war sluiced forth; and I consent to this,</line>
<line>That the conjunction of our English forces</line>
<line>With arms of Germany may soon bring</line>
<line>This prize of conquest in. But, then, my lords,</line>
<line>As in the moral hunting &#8217;twixt the lion</line>
<line>And other beasts, force joined with greed</line>
<line>Frighted the weaker sharers from their parts;</line>
<line>So, if the empire&#8217;s sovereign chance to put</line>
<line>His plea of partnership into war&#8217;s court,</line>
<line>Swords should decide the difference, and our blood</line>
<line>In private tears lament his entertainment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>To doubt the worst is still the wise man&#8217;s shield,</line>
<line>That arms him safely. But the world knows this,</line>
<line>The Emperor is a man of royal faith;</line>
<line>His love unto our sovereign brings him down</line>
<line>From his imperial seat, to march in pay</line>
<line>Under our English flag, and wear the cross,</line>
<line>Like some high order, on his manly breast;</line>
<line>Thus serving, he&#8217;s not master of himself,</line>
<line>But, like a colonel commanding other,</line>
<line>Is by the general over-awed himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROCHESTER.</speaker>
<line>Yet, my good lord&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Let me conclude my speech.</line>
<line>As subjects share no portion in the conquest</line>
<line>Of their true sovereign, other than the merit</line>
<line>That from the sovereign guerdons the true subject;</line>
<line>So the good Emperor, in a friendly league</line>
<line>Of amity with England, will not soil</line>
<line>His honor with the theft of English spoil.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>There is no question but this entertainment</line>
<line>Will be most honorable, most commodious.</line>
<line>I have oft heard good captains wish to have</line>
<line>Rich soldiers to attend them, such as would fight</line>
<line>Both for their lives and livings; such a one</line>
<line>Is the good Emperor. I would to God,</line>
<line>We had ten thousand of such able men!</line>
<line>Hah, then there would appear no court, no city,</line>
<line>But, where the wars were, they would pay themselves.</line>
<line>Then, to prevent in French wars England&#8217;s loss,</line>
<line>Let German flags wave with our English cross.</line>

<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>Madame, what ails ye for to look so sad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Troth, son, I know not what; I am not sick,</line>
<line>And yet I am not well. I would be merry;</line>
<line>But somewhat lies so heavy on heart,</line>
<line>I cannot choose but sigh. You are a scholar;</line>
<line>I pray ye, tell me, may one credit dreams?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>Why ask you that, dear madame?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Because tonight I had the strangest dream</line>
<line>That ere my sleep was troubled with. Me thought twas night,</line>
<line>And that the King and Queen went on the Thames</line>
<line>In barges to hear music. My lord and I</line>
<line>Were in a little boat me thought,&#8212;Lord, Lord,</line>
<line>What strange things live in slumbers!&#8212;and, being near,</line>
<line>We grappled to the barge that bare the king.</line>
<line>But after many pleasing voices spent</line>
<line>In that still moving music house, me though</line>
<line>The violence of the stream did sever us</line>
<line>Quite from the golden fleet, and hurried us</line>
<line>Unto the bridge, which with unused horror</line>
<line>We entered at full tide. Thence some slight shoot</line>
<line>Being carried by the waves, our boat stood still</line>
<line>Just opposite the Tower, and there it turned</line>
<line>And turned about, as when a whirl-pool sucks</line>
<line>The circled waters. Me thought that we both cried,</line>
<line>Till that we sunk. Where arm in arm we died.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>Give no respect, dear madame, to fond dreams:</line>
<line>They are but slight illusions of the blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Tell me not all are so; for often dreams</line>
<line>Are true diviners, either of good or ill:</line>

<line offset="4">Truly, and so have I:</line>
<line>Methought I saw him here in Chelsea Church,</line>
<line>Standing upon the roodloft, now defac&#8217;d;</line>

<stagedir>Enter Sir Thomas More, his Lady, Daughters, Master Roper, Gentlemen, and Servants, as in his house at Chelsea.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, good son Roper.</line>
<line>Sit, good madame,</line>
<stagedir>Low stools.</stagedir>
<line>Upon an humble seat; the time so craves;</line>
<line>Rest your good heart on earth, the roof of graves:</line>
<line>You see the floor of greatness is uneven;</line>
<line>The cricket and high throne alike near heaven.</line>
<line>Now, daughters, you that like to branches spread,</line>
<line>And give best shadow to a private house,</line>
<line>Be comforted, my girls; your hopes stand fair:</line>
<line>Virtue breeds gentry, she makes the best heir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH DAUGHTERS.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow to your honor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Nay, good night rather;</line>
<line>Your honor&#8217;s crest-fain with your happy father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>Oh, what formality, what square observance,</line>
<line>Lives in a little room! Here public care</line>
<line>Gags not the eyes of slumber; here fierce riot</line>
<line>Ruffles not proudly in a coat of trust,</line>
<line>Whilst, like a pawn at chess, he keeps in rank</line>
<line>With kings and mighty fellows; yet indeed</line>
<line>Those men that stand on tiptoe smile to see</line>
<line>Him pawn his fortunes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="8">True, son,&#8212;</line>
<line>Nor does the wanton tongue here screw itself</line>
<line>Into the ear, that like a vise drinks up</line>
<line>The iron instrument.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">We are here at peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Then peace, good wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>For, keeping still in compass, a strange point</line>
<line>In times new navigation we have sailed</line>
<line>Beyond our course.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Have done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>We are exiled the court.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Still thou harpest on that:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis sin for to deserve that banishment;</line>
<line>But he that ne&#8217;er knew court, courts sweet content.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Oh, but, dear husband&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I will not hear thee, wife;</line>
<line>The winding labyrinth of thy strange discourse</line>
<line>Will ne&#8217;er have end. Sit still; and, my good wife,</line>
<line>Entreat thy tongue be still; or, credit me,</line>
<line>Thou shalt not understand a word we speak;</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll talk in Latin.</line>
<line><latin xml:lang="la">Humida vallis raros patitur fulminis ictus,</latin></line>
<line>More rest enjoys the subject meanly bred</line>
<line>Than he that bears the kingdom in his head.</line>
<line>Great men are still musicians, else the world lies;</line>
<line>They learn low strains after the notes that rise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>Good sir, be still yourself, and but remember</line>
<line>How in this general court of short-lived pleasure,</line>
<line>The world, creation is the ample food</line>
<line>That is digested in the maw of time:</line>
<line>If man himself be subject to such ruin,</line>
<line>How shall his garment, then, or the loose points</line>
<line>That tie respect unto his awful place,</line>
<line>Avoid destruction? Most honored father-in-law,</line>
<line>The blood you have bequeathed these several hearts</line>
<line>To nourish your posterity, stands firm;</line>
<line>And, as with joy you led us first to rise,</line>
<line>So with like hearts we&#8217;ll lock preferment&#8217;s eyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Close them not, then, with tears. For that ostent</line>
<line>Gives a wet signal of your discontent.</line>
<line>If you will share my fortunes, comfort then;</line>
<line>An hundred smiles for one sigh. What! We are men:</line>
<line>Resign wet passion to these weaker eyes,</line>
<line>Which proves their sex, but grants it ne&#8217;er more wise.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s now survey our state. Here sits my wife,</line>
<line>And dear esteemed issue; yonder stand</line>
<line>My loving servants. Now the difference</line>
<line>Twixt those and these. Now you shall hear my speak</line>
<line>Like More in melancholy. I conceive that nature</line>
<line>Hath sundry metals, out of which she frames</line>
<line>Us mortals, each in valuation</line>
<line>Outprizing other. Of the finest stuff</line>
<line>The finest features come. The rest of earth,</line>
<line>Receive base fortune even before their birth;</line>
<line>Hence slaves have their creation; and I think</line>
<line>Nature provides content for the base mind;</line>
<line>Under the whip, the burden, and the toil,</line>
<line>Their low-wrought bodies drudge in patience;</line>
<line>As for the prince in all his sweet-gorged maw,</line>
<line>And his rank flesh, that sinfully renews</line>
<line>The noon&#8217;s excess in the night&#8217;s dangerous surfeits.</line>
<line>What means or misery from our birth doth flow</line>
<line>Nature entitles to us; that we owe:</line>
<line>But we, being subject to the rack of hate,</line>
<line>Falling from happy life to bondage state,</line>
<line>Having seen better days, now know the lack</line>
<line>Of glory that once reared each high-fed back.</line>
<line>But you, that in your age did ne&#8217;er view better,</line>
<line>Challenged not fortune for your thriftless debter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATESBY.</speaker>
<line>Sir, we have seen far better days than these.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I was the patron of those days, and know</line>
<line>Those were but painted days, only for show.</line>
<line>Then grieve not you to fall with him that gave them:</line>
<line><latin xml:lang="la">Generosis servis gloriosum mori.</latin></line>
<line>Dear Gough, thou art my learned secretary;</line>
<line>You, Master Catesby, steward of my house;</line>
<line>The rest like you have had fair time to grow</line>
<line>In sun-shine of my fortunes. But I must tell ye,</line>
<line>Corruption is fled hence with each man&#8217;s office;</line>
<line>Bribes, that make open traffic twixt the soul</line>
<line>And netherland of hell, deliver up</line>
<line>Their guilty homage to the second lords.</line>
<line>Then, living thus untainted, you are well:</line>
<line>Truth is no pilot for the land of hell.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter a Servant.</stagedir>

<line>Y&#8217;are just seven score), and tell them what we hear</line>
<line>A virtuous honorable lord hath done</line>
<line>Even for the meanest follower that he had.</line>
<line>This writing found my lady in his study,</line>
<line>This instant morning, wherein is set down</line>
<line>Each servant&#8217;s name, according to his place</line>
<line>And office in the house. On every man</line>
<line>He frankly hath bestown twenty nobles,</line>
<line>The best and worst together, all alike,</line>
<line>Which Master Catesby here forth will pay ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATESBY.</speaker>
<line>Take it as it is meant, a kind remembrance</line>
<line>Of a fair kinder lord, with whose sad fall</line>
<line>He gives up house and farewell to us all:</line>
<line>Thus the fair spreading oak falls not alone,</line>
<line>But all the neighbor plants and under-trees</line>
<line>Are crushed down with his weight. No more of this:</line>
<line>Come, and receive your due, and after go</line>
<line>Fellow-like hence, copartners of one woe.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Sir Thomas More, the Lieutenant, and a Servant attending, as in his chamber in the Tower.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Master Lieutenant, is the warrant come?</line>
<line>If it be so, a God&#8217;s name, let us know it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>My lord, it is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="3">&#8217;Tis welcome, sir, to me</line>
<line>With all my heart. His blessed will be done!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Your wisdom, sir, hath been so well approved,</line>
<line>And your fair patience in imprisonment</line>
<line>Hath ever shewn such constancy of mind</line>
<line>And Christian resolution in all troubles,</line>
<line>As warrant us you are not unprepared.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>No, Master Lieutenant;</line>
<line>I thank my God, I have peace of conscience,</line>
<line>Though the world and I are at a little odds:</line>
<line>But we&#8217;ll be even now, I hope, ere long.</line>
<line>When is the execution of your warrant?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Tomorrow morning.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">So, sir, I thank ye;</line>
<line>I have not lived so ill, I fear to die.</line>
<line>Master Lieutenant, I have had a sore fit of the stone tonight; but the</line>
<line>King hath sent me such a rare receipt, I thank him, as I shall not</line>
<line>Need to fear it much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>In life and death still merry Sir Thomas More.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Sirrah fellow, reach me the urinal:</line>
<stagedir>He gives it him.</stagedir>
<line>Ha! Let me see (there&#8217;s) gravel in the water;</line>
<line>(And yet I see no grave danger in that)</line>
<line>The man were likely to live long enough,</line>
<line>So pleased the king. Here, fellow, take it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<line>Shall I go with it to the doctor, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>No, save thy labor; we&#8217;ll cozen him of a fee:</line>
<line>Thou shalt see me take a dram tomorrow morning,</line>
<line>Shall cure the stone, I warrant; doubt it not.</line>
<line>Master Lieutenant, what news of my Lord of Rochester?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Yesterday morning was he put to death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>The peace of soul sleep with him!</line>
<line>He was a learned and a reverend prelate,</line>
<line>And a rich man, believe me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>If he were rich, what is Sir Thomas More,</line>
<line>That all this while hath been Lord Chancellor?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Say ye so, Master Lieutenant? What do ye think</line>
<line>A man, that with my time had held my place,</line>
<line>Might purchase?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Perhaps, my lord, two thousand pound a year.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Master Lieutenant, I protest to you,</line>
<line>I never had the means in all my life</line>
<line>To purchase one poor hundred pound a year:</line>
<line>I think I am the poorest Chancellor</line>
<line>That ever was in England, though I could wish,</line>
<line>For credit of the place, that my estate were better.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>It&#8217;s very strange.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">It will be found as true.</line>
<line>I think, sir, that with most part of my coin</line>
<line>I have purchased as strange commodities</line>
<line>As ever you heard tell of in your life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Commodities, my lord!</line>
<line>Might I (without offense) inquire of them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Croutches, Master Lieutenant, and bare cloaks;</line>
<line>For halting soldiers and poor needy scholars</line>
<line>Have had my gettings in the Chancery:</line>
<line>To think but what a cheat the crown shall have</line>
<line>By my attainder! I prithee, if thou be&#8217;est a gentleman,</line>
<line>Get but a copy of my inventory.</line>
<line>That part of poet that was given me</line>
<line>Made me a very unthrift;</line>
<line>For this is the disease attends us all,</line>
<line>Poets were never thrifty, never shall.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lady More mourning, Daughters, Master Roper.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Oh, noble More!&#8212;</line>
<line>My lord, your wife, your son-in-law, and daughters.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Son Roper, welcome;&#8212;welcome, wife, and girls.</line>
<line>Why do you weep? Because I live at ease?</line>
<line>Did you not see, when I was Chancellor,</line>
<line>I was so clogged with suitors every hour,</line>
<line>I could not sleep, nor dine, nor sup in quiet?</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s none of this; here I can sit and talk</line>
<line>With my honest keeper half a day together,</line>
<line>Laugh and be merry. Why, then, should you weep?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>These tears, my lord, for this your long restraint</line>
<line>Hope had dried up, with comfort that we yet,</line>
<line>Although imprisoned, might have had your life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>To live in prison, what a life were that!</line>
<line>The king (I thank him) loves me more then so.</line>
<line>Tomorrow I shall be at liberty</line>
<line>To go even whether I can,</line>
<line>After I have dispatched my business.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Ah, husband, husband, yet submit yourself!</line>
<line>Have care of your poor wife and children.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Wife, so I have; and I do leave you all</line>
<line>To his protection hath the power to keep you</line>
<line>Safer than I can,&#8212;</line>
<line>The father of the widow and the orphans.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>The world, my lord, hath ever held you wise;</line>
<line>And &#8217;t shall be no distaste unto your wisdom,</line>
<line>To yield to the opinion of the state.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I have deceived myself, I must acknowledge;</line>
<line>And, as you say, son Roper, to confess the same,</line>
<line>It will be no disparagement at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>His highness shall be certified thereof</line>
<line>Immediately.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Offering to depart.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, hear me, wife; first let me tell ye how:</line>
<line>I thought to have had a barber for my beard;</line>
<line>Now, I remember, that were labor lost,</line>
<line>The headsman now shall cut off head and all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROP. WIFE.</speaker>
<line>Father, his majesty, upon your meek submission,</line>
<line>Will yet (they say) receive you to his grace</line>
<line>In as great credit as you were before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Has appointed me to do a little business.</line>
<line>If that were past, my girl, thou then shouldst see</line>
<line>What I would say to him about that matter;</line>
<line>But I shall be so busy until then,</line>
<line>I shall not tend it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DAUGHTER.</speaker>
<line>Ah, my dear father!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Dear lord and husband!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Be comforted, good wife, to live and love my children;</line>
<line>For with thee leave I all my care of them.</line>
<line>Son Roper, for my sake that have loved thee well,</line>
<line>And for her virtue&#8217;s sake, cherish my child.</line>
<line>Girl, be not proud, but of thy husband&#8217;s love;</line>
<line>Ever retain thy virtuous modesty;</line>
<line>That modesty is such a comely garment</line>
<line>As it is never out of fashion, sits as fair</line>
<line>Upon the meaner woman as the empress;</line>
<line>No stuff that gold can buy is half so rich,</line>
<line>Nor ornament that so becomes a woman.</line>
<line>Live all and love together, and thereby</line>
<line>You give your father a rich obsequy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH DAUGHTERS.</speaker>
<line>Your blessing, dear father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I must be gone&#8212;God bless you!&#8212;</line>
<line>To talk with God, who now doth call.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Aye, my dear husband!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Sweet wife, good night, good night:</line>
<line>God send us all his everlasting light!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>I think, before this hour,</line>
<line>More heavy hearts ne&#8217;er parted in the Tower.</line>

<stagedir>Enter the Sheriffs of London and their Officers at one door, the Warders with their halbards at another.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Officers, what time of day is&#8217;t?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. OFFICER.</speaker>
<line>Almost eight o&#8217;clock.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>We must make haste then, least we stay too long.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. WARDER.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, Master Sheriffs of London; Master Lieutenant</line>
<line>Wills ye repair to the limits of the Tower,</line>
<line>There to receive your prisoner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Go back, and tell his worship we are ready.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Go bid the officers make clear the way,</line>
<line>There may be passage for the prisoner.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Lieutenant and his Guard, with More.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Yet, God be thanked, here&#8217;s a fair day toward,</line>
<line>To take our journey in. Master Lieutenant,</line>
<line>It were fair walking on the Tower leads.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>And so it might have liked my sovereign lord,</line>
<line>I would to God you might have walked there still!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He weeps.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Sir, we are walking to a better place.</line>
<line>Oh, sir, your kind and loving tears</line>
<line>Are like sweet odors to embalm your friend!</line>
<line>Thank your good lady; since I was your guest,</line>
<line>She has made me a very wanton, in good sooth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Oh, I had hoped we should not yet have parted!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>But I must leave ye for a little while;</line>
<line>Within an hour or two you may look for me;</line>
<line>But there will be so many come to see me,</line>
<line>That I shall be so proud, I will not speak;</line>
<line>And, sure, my memory is grown so ill,</line>
<line>I fear I shall forget my head behind me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>God and his blessed angels be about ye!&#8212;</line>
<line>Here, Master Sheriffs, receive your prisoner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, Master Sheriffs of London, to ye both:</line>
<line>I thank ye that ye will vouchsafe to meet me;</line>
<line>I see by this you have not quite forgot</line>
<line>That I was in times past, as you are now,</line>
<line>A sheriff of London.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Sir, then you know our duty doth require it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I know it well, sir, else I would have been glad</line>
<line>You might have saved a labor at this time.</line>
<line>Ah, Master Sheriff, you and I have been of old acquaintance! You were a patient auditor of mine, when I read the divinity lecture at St. Lawrence&#8217;s.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Sir Thomas More, I have heard you oft,</line>
<line>As many other did, to our great comfort.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Pray God, you may so now, with all my heart!</line>
<line>And, as I call to mind,</line>
<line>When I studied the law in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn,</line>
<line>I was of council with ye in a cause.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>I was about to say so, good Sir Thomas...</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Oh, is this the place?</line>
<line>I promise ye, it is a goodly scaffold:</line>
<line>In sooth, I am come about a headless errand,</line>
<line>For I have not much to say, now I am here.</line>
<line>Well, let&#8217;s ascend, i&#8217;God&#8217;s name:</line>
<line>In troth, methinks, your stair is somewhat weak;</line>
<line>I prithee, honest friend, lend me thy hand</line>
<line>To help me up; as for my coming down,</line>
<line>Let me alone, I&#8217;ll look to that myself.</line>
<stagedir>As he is going up the stairs, enters the Earls of Surrey and Shrewsbury.</stagedir>
<line>My Lords of Surrey and Shrewsbury, give me your hands. Yet before we...ye see, though it pleaseth the king to raise me thus high, yet I am not proud, for the higher I mount, the better I can see my friends about me. I am now on a far voyage, and this strange wooden horse must bear me thither; yet I perceive by your looks you like my bargain so ill, that there&#8217;s not one of ye all dare enter with me. Truly, here&#8217;s a most sweet gallery;</line>
<stagedir>Walking.</stagedir>
<line>I like the air of it better than my garden at Chelsea. By your patience, good people, that have pressed thus into my bedchamber, if you&#8217;ll not trouble me, I&#8217;ll take a sound sleep here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, &#8217;twere good you&#8217;ld publish to the world</line>
<line>Your great offense unto his majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I&#8217;ll bequeath this legacy to the hangman,</line>
<stagedir>Gives him his gown.</stagedir>
<line>and do it instantly. I confess, his majesty hath been ever good to me; and my offense to his highness makes me of a state pleader a stage player (though I am old, and have a bad voice), to act this last scene of my tragedy. I&#8217;ll send him (for my trespass) a reverend head, somewhat bald; for it is not requisite any head should stand covered to so high majesty. If that content him not, because I think my body will then do me small pleasure, let him but bury it, and take it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, my lord, hold conference with your soul;</line>
<line>You see, my lord, the time of life is short.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I see it, my good lord; I dispatched that business the last night. I come hither only to be let blood; my doctor here tells me it is good for the headache.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>I beseech thee, my lord, forgive me!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Forgive thee, honest fellow! Why?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>For your death, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>O, my death? I had rather it were in thy power to forgive me, for thou hast the sharpest action against me; the law, my honest friend, lies in thy hands now. Here&#8217;s thy fee;</line>
<stagedir>His purse.</stagedir>
<line>and, my good fellow, let my suit be dispatched presently; for &#8217;tis all one pain, to die a lingering death, and to live in the continual mill of a lawsuit. But I can tell thee, my neck is so short, that, if thou shouldst behead an hundred noblemen like myself, thou wouldst ne&#8217;er get credit by it; therefore (look ye, sir), do it handsomely, or, of my word, thou shalt never deal with me hereafter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll take an order for that, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>One thing more; take heed thou cutst not off my beard. Oh, I forgot; execution passed upon that last night, and the body of it lies buried in the Tower. Stay; is&#8217;t not possible to make a scape from all this strong guard? It is.</line>
<line>There is a thing within me, that will raise</line>
<line>And elevate my better part bove sight</line>
<line>Of these same weaker eyes; and, Master Sheriffs,</line>
<line>For all this troop of steel that tends my death,</line>
<line>I shall break from you, and fly up to heaven.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s seek the means for this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I pray ye, put off your doublet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Speak not so coldly to me; I am hoarse already;</line>
<line>I would be loathe, good fellow, to take more.</line>
<line>Point me the block; I ne&#8217;er was here before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>To the east side, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Then to the east</line>
<line>We go to sigh; that o&#8217;er, to sleep in rest.</line>
<line>Here More forsakes all mirth; good reason why;</line>
<line>The fool of flesh must with her frail life die.</line>
<line>No eye salute my trunk with a sad tear:</line>
<line>Our birth to heaven should be thus, void of fear.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit with Hangman, etc.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>A very learned worthy gentleman</line>
<line>Seals error with his blood. Come, we&#8217;ll to court.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s sadly hence to perfect unknown fates,</line>
<line>Whilst he tends prograce to the state of states.</line>
